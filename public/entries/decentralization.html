    <p>I’ve been interested in the blockchain space since high school and began doing more work in the space around
        two
        years ago. In this short time, the landscape of crypto has changed drastically — from the speculation of its
        value
        add to business operations and to the technology itself. As someone who’s gone through the whole cycle of
        being
        a
        believer and a skeptic, I wanted to articulate my current stance on Web3, which is this:</p>
    <b>The ethos surrounding decentralization is plainly wrong.</b>
    <p>Blockchain technologies are built around three pillars: decentralization, transparency, and immutability.
        These
        are
        the same that gave birth to the idea of Web3, which is an internet paradigm that allows users to not only
        read
        and
        create but also own their data. I believe that all three of these pillars are fundamentally flawed as net
        negatives
        but for the most part, the buzz around decentralization is one of the biggest drivers of people’s initial
        interest,
        which is why I’m focusing on this. The issue with decentralization is two-fold: it’s difficult to ensure as
        a
        protocol and offers tradeoffs with overrated upside to users. I believe that this is a fundamental flaw for
        almost
        all Web3 technologies, which is why we see little mainstream adoption today.</p>
    <h4 style="font-size: 1.35em;
        margin-bottom: -0.5em">End-to-end Decentralization</h4>
    <p>First, true decentralization requires that no single entity can manipulate the system at any point in its
        end-to-end
        flow. This is a strong and extremely restrictive guarantee since a consequence of this is that a system
        cannot
        interact with non-decentralized components — anything not on the blockchain. The internet today, or Web2,
        took
        off
        because it enabled the rapid, global exchange of culture and ideas. It’s nearly impossible to imagine how
        any
        notion
        of a new internet could get started as a silo, without being integrated with the data we use daily.</p>
    <p>Even if blockchain does have utility without off-chain data, there still exist decentralization issues within
        its
        workflow. Any network that sells itself on security is defined by its weakest link. As blockchain workflows
        have
        become more complex to accommodate smart contracts or improve scalability, it has given rise to more
        vulnerabilities
        that are at risk of contradicting the decentralization of the chain.</p>
    <h4 style="font-size: 1em;
        margin-bottom: -0.5em">Maximum Extractable Value</h4>
    <p>One example of this is Maximum Extractable Value, or MEV, where miners can re-order the transactions in a
        block
        to
        make money off front-runnin. It takes advantage of a single point in the process where a miner has the sole
        discretion to decide which transactions to include in a block and can front-run or sandwich user
        transactions.
        To
        date, over a billion dollars have been generated by MEV strategies [1], with one user profiting $34M in just
        three
        months [2]. Yes, one miner cannot profitably corrupt the security of the chain, but the vulnerability of
        user
        transactions to such attacks contradicts the ethos of decentralization. </p>
    <h4 style="font-size: 1em;
        margin-bottom: -0.5em">Layer 2 Scaling</h4>
    <p>A second, broader concern about centralization lies in the Layer 2 community. L2s are smaller chains designed
        to
        offload some transactions from an L1 (e.g. Ethereum) to improve scalability. These transactions are run on
        the
        L2
        and their outputs are bridged back to the L1. In April of this year, over 82% of all Ethereum transactions
        were
        settled on L2s [3]. By nature, L2s offer weaker security guarantees because they’re smaller in size, more
        fractured
        market-share wise, and rely on the L1 in exchange for lower gas costs.</p>
    <p>In L2s, transactions are bundled into batches and executed, and only the final state is recorded on the L1.
        Because
        L2s are designed purely for scalability, instead of mining and bundling transactions into a block
        centralized
        entities called sequencers decide which transactions are included in a batch. As a result, they have sole
        discretion
        over MEV, censorship, and network availability. The challenge with having decentralized sequencers, or
        allowing
        anyone to submit batches, is that batches that aren’t selected have wasted computation and electing a batch
        is
        less
        efficient.</p>
    <h4 style="font-size: 1.35em;
        margin-bottom: -0.5em">Effects on User Experience</h4>
    <p>This is the truth underlying any decentralized system, which is that it will have important tradeoffs
        compared to
        a
        centralized counterpart. Centralized systems by default provide a consensus contract that all users follow
        to
        get
        the current state. Without a centralized facilitator to decide on consensus, the users themselves interact
        to
        keep
        the system consistent. As a result, a single direction of communication must necessarily be replaced by
        multiple
        rounds of communication between nodes and possibly financial incentives for doing this work. This is a
        commonly
        studied tradeoff in distributed systems when decentralized systems are used to prevent single points of
        failure.
    </p>
    <p>Hence, blockchains can compensate by either increasing user costs and latency or loosening decentralization
        and
        network security. Because the latter is the fundamental value add that the industry is built on, the user
        experience
        becomes at risk.</p>
    <p>This is an ongoing back-and-forth that developers in the space have to grapple with. In fact, most of the
        issues
        I
        pointed out above can be mitigated by replacing a single point of failure with a quorum-based layer. For
        example,
        Chainlink offers access to off-chain data through its oracle network that aggregates the results of
        off-chain
        queries from its system of nodes. However, this comes at a rising cost in transaction latency and gas for
        the
        user.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, the big question when valuing the utility of the blockchain space circles back to how much users
        are
        willing to trade-off between cost, latency, and having the benefit of decentralization. Unfortunately, I
        believe
        this willingness is low. </p>
    <h4 style="font-size: 1.35em;
        margin-bottom: -0.5em">Value Proposition (?)</h4>
    <p>From a financial use-case perspective, the banking system in the US is heavily regulated and consumers have
        legal
        protections against fraud. It’s far from perfect, but it’s something that the vast majority of Americans can
        and
        have reasonably relied on for their needs, making decentralization a limited value add. Furthermore, the
        promise
        of
        decentralization is not at all an immediate guarantee of security. With $19B lost to crypto hacks to date [4],
        there
        are
        legitimate concerns about storing funds on-chain. The transparent and immutable nature of blockchain is
        actually
        more susceptible to costly hacks due to exposed backend code. </p>
    <p>From a social case, the idea of internet companies collecting user data sounds pervasive, but does it sound
        pervasive
        enough that users will be willing to pay for interactions with an alternative that also operates a little
        slower? I
        would bet on no. Yes, corporations may own and sell our data exploitatively, but our data isn’t being
        exposed to
        public APIs for anyone to access (which is a concern for on-chain transactions). Additionally, we still reap
        some
        benefits of consumerism like recommended content or friends at no cost. As it is, I believe the current
        system
        is
        not threatened by a riskier, unproven alternative.</p>
    <h4 style="font-size: 1em;
        margin-bottom: -0.5em">Upside</h4>
    <p>With that said, I do think there are two areas where blockchain applications can succeed. First, when the
        central
        entity is unreliable or already expensive. Examples of this would be banking in regions with political
        instability
        and conducting cross-border payments. These applications are already popular in areas like South America
        today.
        I
        could see this being an important use case of crypto that remains indefinitely.</p>
    <p>The second is in cases where the central entity is logistically challenging or risky to set up. For example,
        a
        company could release a token to immediately form a two-sided market between producers and consumers instead
        of
        raising capital to bootstrap initial adoption themselves. This is different from paying in cash because
        users
        can
        individually value the token based on their long/short belief in the product. I’m mainly thinking about
        decentralized physical infrastructure networks here, but different use cases may exist based on these same
        principles.</p>
    <h4 style="font-size: 1.35em;
        margin-bottom: -0.5em">Conclusion</h4>
    <p>In short, crypto and Web3 are inherently limited by the challenges of decentralization. In seven years, over
        $90
        billion has been invested as venture capital into the industry [5], and there has been no significant,
        mainstream
        user
        application to lend credibility to claims that Web3 will ultimately replace our current notion of the
        internet.
        I do
        buy that crypto has the potential to become (or remain) a useful application in the two areas above, but I
        don’t
        think it will be anything more than just a tool, albeit an important one. </p>
    <p>The bottom line is that when an alternative technology introduces cost and efficiency tradeoffs to consumers
        like
        Web3 does, its edge against the prior becomes narrowed. Therefore, and given how the space has unfolded to
        date,
        I
        think it’s unlikely that this paradigm will materialize. </p>
